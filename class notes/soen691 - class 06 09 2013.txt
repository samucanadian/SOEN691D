mining open source software repositories


course goal: using machine learning. 


Problem 				| Data			| Clean link	|	Model (statistics)
Target buggy files for more testing	| -bug repo 		| Bug 56	|	- linear

Bugfile~complexity

write more complex files has 10x as many bugs as .... 


presentation 1 
slide 3
effects on number of defects 

continuous integration
turnover
refactoring
social interactions among devs
complexity of code 

statistics:
p-value   0.5  is valid
files size ....
magnitude of the difference
normalized data (linear regression)


grades 

soft practice exam 40%   (mid november) 

bug fix on an OSS project 20%

in class discussions and simple summaries of papers 15%   -paper presentation 

research paper including model of data  25% - 


alternatives to grading scheme ....  

experienced researcher ---can skip the bug fix project 
or weight from exam can be added to paper. 

excellent program 
fix more bugs, less on research project

must convince Peter of where you want to spend time and effort 


you can do it alone or group of 2 ... 



research project 

choose a problem (and related literature)
choose data and software product to study
analyze data (weka or R)
Write a four page, double column report

Presentation 

everyonde will pick and present their favorite paper (relate to research project)
Me next week ... 


Bug fix project 

contact 

Mozilla data - in a hard drive ... every single bug everything etc.... EXCELLENT TO KNOW . 



Mozilla came from Netscape, they first provided freely their code.


Latent structure 
Commercial software project managers design project organizational structure carefully, 
Open Source Software (OSS) Projects, which have no pre-designed organizational structure.
However, in large, complex, successful, OSS projects, we expect that sub-communities spontaneously arise within the bazaar as OSS systems and the teams evolve. We also find that these subgroups manifest most strongly in technical discussions, and are significantly connected with collaboration behaviour.

modularity - calculating the smallest path between the people .... the areas stuff I am doing 

Cris Bird got this modularity 


bikeshed impact  --- trivial conversation leads to high peer review with lots of not interesting discussion (deviates the main goal of the issue subject) - 
from the table "Bike Shed Impact?" - the less is the outsiders participation in discussions groups the less is the time for review. 

Three successful examples of OSS: Firefox revenue of 163 million in 2011 and Red Hat 1.13 millions in 2012 and Linux 2.4 billion dollars first quarter 2012

Agile manifesto
Individuals and interactions over processes
and tools
• Working software over comprehensive
documentation
• Customer collaboration over contract
negotiation
• Responding to change over following a plan

Frequent integration 
 Patches = can be a group of commits being pushed together 
• Branches 
• Tools  = features  .

an advantage of OSS is that users can be co-developers of the project 
so if an user found out a bug in the software he would have more knowledge to comprehend which would be the root cause.

opensource project?   source is freely available and is free for download 

OSS Processes
• Keep the parts that work
• Throw out any redundant or excessive
formality


Its License
• Three types
• GNU General Public License
• Mozilla Public License
• BSD License

Do they threaten software development companies and
paid developers?
No because Source code is freely
available and distributable

Why OSS projects costs a loot even being freely available to public? 
Because of the branding, the importance of the brand. 
- Brand, people will know you
• Good will - Investing money into a
community project
• Critical mass of users
• It’s the competition and will exist anyways
• Technical know how and infrastructure


OSS Dev Motivation
- Interested in the development problem 
- Build CV
- Money not important


what differentiates the opensource are the free licenses
GNU - general public license
Mozilla Publi license 
BSD license   

it is viral because if ex: I use the Linux code and I create my code ... I could not just sell it .. because it is viral .. it has become free because Linux is free . 


ways of making money  ---- ended here.
